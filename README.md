# TEDxSIST Admin-App  

## Overview  

The **TEDxSIST Admin-App** is a web-based administrative platform designed to streamline the management of TEDxSIST events. It provides tools for participant selection, automated email communication, QR code-based check-ins, and certificate generation.  

The app is fully deployed and accessible at:  
ðŸ”— [TEDxSIST Admin Panel](https://admin.tedxsist.com)  

## Features
